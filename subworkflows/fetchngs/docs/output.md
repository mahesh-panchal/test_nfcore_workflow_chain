# nf-core/fetchngs: Output

## Introduction

This document describes the output produced by the pipeline. The directories listed below will be created in the results directory after the pipeline has finished. All paths are relative to the top-level results directory.

## Pipeline overview

The pipeline is built using [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/) and processes data depending on the type of ids provided:

* Download FastQ files and create samplesheet from:
    1. [SRA / ENA / DDBJ / GEO ids](#sra--ena--ddbj--geo-ids)
    2. [Synapse ids](#synapse-ids)
* [Pipeline information](#pipeline-information) - Report metrics generated during the workflow execution

Please see the [usage documentation](https://nf-co.re/fetchngs/usage#introduction) for a list of supported public repository identifiers and how to provide them to the pipeline.

### SRA / ENA / DDBJ / GEO ids

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Output files</summary>

* `fastq/`
    * `*.fastq.gz`: Paired-end/single-end reads downloaded from the SRA / ENA / DDBJ / GEO.
* `fastq/md5/`
    * `*.md5`: Files containing `md5` sum for FastQ files downloaded from the ENA.
* `samplesheet/`
    * `samplesheet.csv`: Auto-created samplesheet with collated metadata and paths to downloaded FastQ files.
    * `id_mappings.csv`: File with selected fields that can be used to rename samples to more informative names; see [`--sample_mapping_fields`](https://nf-co.re/fetchngs/parameters#sample_mapping_fields) parameter to customise this behaviour.
    * `multiqc_config.yml`: [MultiQC](https://multiqc.info/docs/#bulk-sample-renaming) config file that can be passed to most nf-core pipelines via the `--multiqc_config` parameter for bulk renaming of sample names from database ids; [`--sample_mapping_fields`](https://nf-co.re/fetchngs/parameters#sample_mapping_fields) parameter to customise this behaviour.
* `metadata/`
    * `*.runinfo_ftp.tsv`: Re-formatted metadata file downloaded from the ENA.
    * `*.runinfo.tsv`: Original metadata file downloaded from the ENA.

</details>

The final sample information for all identifiers is obtained from the ENA which provides direct download links for FastQ files as well as their associated md5 sums. If download links exist, the files will be downloaded in parallel by FTP. Otherwise they are downloaded using sra-tools.

### Synapse ids

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Output files</summary>

* `fastq/`
    * `*.fastq.gz`: Paired-end/single-end reads downloaded from Synapse.
* `fastq/md5/`
    * `*.md5`: Files containing `md5` sum for FastQ files downloaded from the Synapse platform.
* `samplesheet/`
    * `samplesheet.csv`: Auto-created samplesheet with collated metadata and paths to downloaded FastQ files.
* `metadata/`
    * `*.metadata.txt`: Original metadata file generated using the `synapse show` command.
    * `*.list.txt`: Original output of the `synapse list` command, containing the Synapse ids, file version numbers, file names, and other file-specific data for the Synapse directory ID provided.

</details>

FastQ files and corresponding sample information for `Synapse` identifiers are downloaded in parallel directly from the [Synapse](https://www.synapse.org/#) platform. A [configuration file](http://python-docs.synapse.org/build/html/Credentials.html#use-synapseconfig) containing valid login credentials is required for Synapse downloads.

The final sample information for the FastQ files downloaded from `Synapse` is obtained from the file name itself. The file names are parsed according to the glob pattern `*{1,2}*`. This returns the sample name, presumed to be the longest possible string matching the glob pattern, with the fewest number of wildcard insertions. Further information on sample name parsing can be found in the [usage documentation](https://nf-co.re/fetchngs/usage#introduction).

### Pipeline information

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Output files</summary>

* `pipeline_info/`
    * Reports generated by Nextflow: `execution_report.html`, `execution_timeline.html`, `execution_trace.txt` and `pipeline_dag.dot`/`pipeline_dag.svg`.
    * Reports generated by the pipeline: `pipeline_report.html`, `pipeline_report.txt` and `software_versions.tsv`.

</details>

[Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/tracing.html) provides excellent functionality for generating various reports relevant to the running and execution of the pipeline. This will allow you to troubleshoot errors with the running of the pipeline, and also provide you with other information such as launch commands, run times and resource usage.
